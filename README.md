# Story:

A post-apocalyptic world. 

As an old man left to fend for yourself in a hospital evacuated long ago, your only choices of surviving are to run or hide from whatever could be waiting for you outside. 

But alas, you must manage your weak heart in the midst of the terror...

- Get as far as possible in the hospital.
- Avoid being watched by the giant eye.
- Manage your heart health, be watched by the eye for too long and a heart attack is imminent.

# Notes:
- Implemented a Behaviour Tree for the Eye AI.
- Used URP for the eye lighting, ceiling lights, and shadows. As well as Post-processing.
- Implemented runtime spawning of the rooms using preconfigured room prefabs, enabling infinite levels.
- Used Post-Processing to control effects at runtime:
  - Camera Shake.
  - Bloom.
  - Exposure.
  - Vignette.
  - Film Grain.
- Used Singletons for various Managers in the scene.
